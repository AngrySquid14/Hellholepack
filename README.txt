yeah

I haven't updated the actual files while i'm writing this but there should be a forge installer.

Run that.

then go to:
    %appdata%/.minecraft/
and either open or create a folder called "mods" (lowercase)

drag the mods from the similar location in the zip file into mods folder under .minecraft

there should be a new instance in the launcher.

launch the game

ip is dumpcraft.apexmc.co
